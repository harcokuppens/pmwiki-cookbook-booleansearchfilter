Description%0a%0aCookbook script to add a search form on a HTML page to search items using a boolean expression of words, making none-matched items hidden, and making the searched words highlighted in the matched items.%0aThe booleansearchfilter cookbook script is a wrapper around the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/boolean-search-filter | Boolean Search Filter JavaScript library]]. The @@[=(:booleansearchfilter:)=]@@directive inserts a @@&lt;div&gt;@@ tag, where the library dynamically creates a Boolean search form. You can see the library in action at the following [[https://raw.githack.com/harcokuppens/boolean-search-filter/ac1f976ebc9feac38f76909d952ef25e6996775e/example/index.html | URL]].%0a%0aThe details of the booleansearchfilter cookbook are described at [[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/booleansearchfilter | the booleansearchfilter cookbook's recipe page ]]. %0aThis wiki contains also a  [[Main.booleansearchfilter  |local version of the cookbook's recipe page]]. You can use the local version for editing before publishing it on the PmWiki website. %0aThe source code of this cookbook is at [[https://github.com/harcokuppens/pmwiki-cookbook-booleansearchfilter| the cookbook's repository]], which also provides a devcontainer in %0awhich you can see the plugin in action and further develop it. %0aThe devcontainer is based on the basic pmwiki devcontainer at https://github.com/harcokuppens/pmwiki-basic.%0a%0a!!
