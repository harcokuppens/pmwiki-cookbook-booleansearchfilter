## Description

This repository defines a basic pmwiki installation in devcontainer which you can use
to develop or test either

- a wiki (default)
- a cookbook script

By default the `pmwiki-basic` repository is setup to run a basic pmwiki website. You
can use it as a sandbox to play with PmWiki, but you can use it to also test an
existing wiki site with newer software. For example you could setup `pmwiki-basic` to
use a newer PmWiki distribution, by editing the `PMWIKI_VERSION` in
`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` configuration file, and then mirror in an
existing's wiki's data using
[the `pmwiki_mirror_remote_site` helper script](#helper-scripts) in the container.

This repository can also be used as an base for a cookbook specific repository to
publish your cookbook script with example pages. This allows you to directly view the
cookbook in action using docker compose. The `pmwiki-basic` repository can be
transformed into a cookbook repository by using a `setup` script. This `setup` script
creates a README, new devcontainer config files, and pmwiki pages specific for a
cookbook repository. The `setup` script makes it easy to create a new a cookbook
repository.

## Requirements

To run the devcontainer you need installed

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- `bash` shell with `envsubst` command

Linux and Macos by default come with a bash shell. However Macos ships with an very
old dated version of bash, so it is advised to install a more modern bash with
homebrew. For Windows machines you can used the "Git Bash" program which gets
installed with ["Git for Windows"](https://gitforwindows.org).

For the `envsubst` command

- for Macos(using brew package manager)/Linux(using apt package manager) install the
  gettext package.
- for windows the "Git Bash" shell has by default `envsubst` installed.

## PmWiki Credentials

PmWiki allows you to login as an user to edit pages or do any online configuration.

By default we already configured two accounts in `data/local/config.php`:

- a test user which can edit pages:
  - username: testuser
  - password: testuser
- an administrator account which has all rights:
  - username: admin
  - password: admin

## Getting started with just wiki

To just run the container with the wiki you can run it directly with docker compose:

     docker compose  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml  up -d

This command causes the pmwiki container to be build and launched. For opening the
container with vscode see the section
[Opening devcontainer with vscode](#opening-devcontainer-with-vscode).

Then open in browser:

     https://localhost:8080
              or
     https://localhost:8443

## Getting started with a wiki for developing a cookbook script

If you want to develop a cookbook script the following steps gives you a good
development environment in a devcontainer which you can also publish to demonstrate
the cookbook:

1.  edit configuration in .

        .devcontainer/config.bash

    Change here the name of the cookbook, and the cookbook's repository url where you
    are going to store the cookbook's files. We use the pmwiki-base repo as base repo
    for the cookbook's repository.

2.  then generate directories, container setup files, and wiki pages for the cookbook
    by running

        .devcontainer/setup

3.  now we can run the container with

        docker compose  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml  up -d

    This command causes the pmwiki container to be build and launched. For opening
    the container with vscode see the section
    [Opening devcontainer with vscode](#opening-devcontainer-with-vscode).

4.  Then open in browser:

        https://localhost:8080
                  or
        https://localhost:8443

Note that everything related to the devcontainer is within the `.devcontainer/`
folder, giving a clean separation between devcontainer and your cookbook files.

The `setup` script changed files in the repository to create a new project focusing
on the specific cookbook of the project. For example it generates a new README.md
file at the root of the project to describe the cookbook and how to use and develop
in it. All technical instructions are already in the README.md file. The developer
only needs to add the description of the cookbook and its usage details. For more
details about the `setup` script see the section
[What does cookbook setup script do?](#what-does-cookbook-setup-script-do).

When done developing the cookbook then you could commit the source files in the
current project to an own repository dedicated to the cookbook. A good example where
we also did this is
[the ImagePopup cookbook repository](https://github.com/harcokuppens/pmwiki-cookbook-imagepopup/).

## Local folders binded into container

Mount binding lets you conveniently edit files locally on your docker host, and lets
you persist these folders when the container is restarted from scratch.

The following folders will be binded into the container:

- `wiki.d` for wiki pages
- `uploads`: for attachments/pictures in pages
- `local`: for the `local.php` configuration file
- `cookbook/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK}`: for binding only my cookbook's `php` script(s)
- `pub/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK}`: for binding only my cookbook's `pub` file(s)

The last two are only bounded when you have run the cookbook setup. Only the cookbook
subdirectory is mounted, because as developer you are only interested in that
specific cookbook. Next to that the `pub/` directory also containers files installed
by pmwiki which you do not want to mess with.

## Open bash shell in container

Because the `docker exec` command by default uses the user defined in `Dockerfile` or
`docker-compose.yml` the following command will open a bash shell with the `root`
user:

    docker exec -it pmwiki-base-ctr bash

However, the apache server and php code engine will operate using the `www-data`
user. Hence, when editing via a bash shell one can better open the shell with the
`www-data` user:

    docker exec -it -u www-data pmwiki-base-ctr bash

## View logs

You can view the logs with:

     docker compose  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml  logs -f

## Opening devcontainer with vscode

Instead of starting the devcontainer with `docker compose` you can also open it with
vscode. In vscode you have `php` debugging support. Convenient if you want to develop
a cookbook `php` script.

Open project from folder in vscode with command

    'Dev Containers: Open folder in Container...'

or from command line when in folder:

      code .

The vscode editor will opening the folder detect the `.devcontainer/` folder and ask
you to "Reopen in Container". When you confirm then vscode will be opened in the
container. Vscode will use as workspace folder `/var/www/html/pmwiki` inside the
container.

In vscode you are working inside the devcontainer, so if you open a terminal window
within vscode it gives you a bash shell within the devcontainer.

The devcontainer is setup to use the user `www-data` used by apache and php as the
`remoteUser`. This setting makes the vscode editor to log in the container using the
`www-data` user. Which means that the vscode editor uses the `www-data` when editing
files making sure they can always be read by apache and php.

Then open in browser:

     https://localhost:8080
              or
     https://localhost:8443

Within vscode you can then easily edit and debug php code. The `Dockerfile` for the
container has already buildin a `launch.json` for debugging with xdebug within
vscode. So everything is already setup to directly debug php code.

## Helper scripts

Helper scripts available in the `bin/` directory of this repository, but also builtin
to the container for direct usage within the container.

- `pmwiki_exportfile` `INPUTFILE` `OUTPUTFILE`

  Exports latest source of wikipage `INPUTFILE` as text in `OUTPUTFILE`.

- `pmwiki_importfile` `INPUTFILE` `OUTPUTFILE`

  Imports text content of `INPUTFILE` as a wikipage in `OUTPUTFILE`.

- `pmwiki_mirror_remote_site` `USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTEPMWIKIDIR`

  Mirror a remote site without overwriting the new cookbook we are locally
  developing. **Run this script from a shell in your container.** This can be useful
  to test a new cookbook within an existing wiki site.

  The full documentation of `pmwiki_mirror_remote_site` is given when run without
  arguments:

      $ pmwiki_mirror_remote_site
      USAGE

        pmwiki_mirror_remote_site [-d SUBDIR]* [-c COOKBOOKNAME]* [-s MAXSIZE] [-l LOCALPMWIKIDIR]  USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTEPMWIKIDIR

      DESCRIPTION

        Mirror a remote site without overwriting the new cookbook we are locally developing.
        In that way we can test our cookbook within the remote setup and data.

        The local site could have a different pmwiki install as the remote site.
        We can use this to test the remote site in a new pmwiki version.
        Only added items to an original pmwiki installation are mirrored. That is only the
        configuration, cookbook extensions,  the wiki pages and its uploads are
        mirrored from the remote site. The means we mirror only the subfolders local/, cookbook/,
        wiki.d/, uploads/ and pub/.

        The name of the new cookbook is determined from the COOKBOOK environment variable.
        Your cookbook X can consist of directories pmwiki/cookbook/X/ and pmwiki/pub/X/. When
        the remote site is mirrored we make sure that we keep these folders of your cookbook X,
        because when mirroring from a remote side not having these folders they would get removed!
        So what you finally get is the remote cookbook/ and pub/ folder with your cookbook folders
        added.

        The argument USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTEPMWIKIDIR is an rsync remote location using the SSH protocol
        to mirror the files.

        This script's behavior:
          - the name of your cookbook is taken from the COOKBOOK environment variable.
          - the folder /var/www/html/pmwiki is taken as the local pmwiki folder into which data gets mirrored.
          - files bigger then 0.5MB are skipped from mirroring

        Options:

         -d SUBDIR
            Add extra sub directory in remote location to be mirrored. Multiple -d options may be specified.
         -c COOKBOOKNAME
            Specify a cookbook to excluded from mirroring. By default the value from the COOKBOOK environment
            variable is taken, but is ignored if this option is given. Multiple -c options may be specified.
         -s MAXSIZE
            Files with this size or larger are not mirrored. Default MAXSIZE=0.5m (half megabyte).
            With MAXSIZE=0 then all files are mirrored.
         -l LOCALPMWIKIDIR
            Specifiy a different location for the local PmWiki directory. Default is /var/www/html/pmwiki.

  By default the name of the cookbook is determined from the `COOKBOOK` environment
  variable, which by default is already set inside the containers environment.

## Container configuration files

The following config files are used for the devcontainer

- `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`

  Configuration for the containers to run, which can be used within vscode, but also
  without vscode when using `docker compose` directly. This compose has only one
  container, the container `pmwiki` defined in `.devcontainer/pmwiki/`. Because we
  only use one container we could have defined to use a `Dockerfile` directly in
  vscode's `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file. However the
  `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` lets us easily define extra options in how to
  use the container. Eg. port mappings and bindings.

  To avoid port conflicts we map port 80 to 8080 and port 443 to 8443, where we
  expose them only on the localhost interface. Edit this file if you want to use
  other port mappings. You can also change the used version of PmWiki in the
  `PMWIKI_VERSION` argument to the PmWiki container.

  The docker compose configuration bind mounts the following local folders inside the
  local `./data/` folder into the `/var/www/html/pmwiki/` folder inside the `pmwiki`
  container:

  - `wiki.d` for wiki pages
  - `uploads`: for attachments/pictures in pages
  - `local`: for the `local.php` configuration file

  When you run the `setup` script to setup the project specificly for a cookbook
  script, then the modified `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` also bind mounts the
  following folders into the container:

  - `cookbook/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}`: for binding only my cookbook's `php`
    script(s)
  - `pub/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}`: for binding only my cookbook's `pub` file(s)

  Note that these bindings could also be defined in the
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file, but by defining it in the
  `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` the bindings also are applied when not using
  vscode.

- `.devcontainer/pmwiki/Dockerfile`

  The `Dockerfile` defines how the PmWiki container is build. It installs the PmWiki
  version `PMWIKI_VERSION` defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The webserver
  used is `apache` on which also `SSL` is enabled. The PmWiki website uses the
  configuration set in `local/config.php` in the local repository folder. It also
  uses the local folders `wiki.d`, `uploads`, and `local`.

  and `cookbook` by bind mounting them in the container. As developer you can then
  easily place your cookbook script and test pages locally and use them in the
  container.

  The container is run with the `root` user. This is the same as on a normal linux
  distribution where the apache server is initially run as root to be able to open
  the lower privilige ports, after which the apache server switches to the `www-data`
  user.

- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

  Configuration file for vscode the devcontainer which specifies that vscode

  - use as workspace folder `/var/www/html/pmwiki`
  - use docker compose with file `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`
  - use `pmwiki` container in vscode as devcontainer
  - use some plugins in vscode for developing `php`

  this file is only used by vscode, and isn't used if you used `docker compose` to
  start the devcontainer directly.

## What does cookbook `setup` script do?

As explained in the [Description](#description) above the `pmwiki-basic` repository
is by default setup to run a basic pmwiki website. But you can use its `setup` script
to transform the repository in a new cookbook specific repository.

The `setup` script does read in configuration parameters from
`.devcontainer/config.bash` and uses them to fill in the templates in the
`.devcontainer/templates/` folder.

The `.devcontainer/config.bash` file contains the following configuration parameters:

- `CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME`: the name of the cookbook which must start with capital
  letter (default: "MyCookbook")
- `CONFIG_COOKBOOK_VERSION`: the version of the cookbook script. By default "1.0.0",
  but often a date like 20241031 is much more convenient as a version.
- `CONFIG_COOKBOOK_AUTHOR`: the name of the author of the cookbook script (default:
  "unknown").
- `CONFIG_COOKBOOK_REPO_URL`: the url of the github repository of the cookbook.

It creates using the templates the following files:

- `README.md`: a readme describing the cookbook and explaining how to use it.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:
  configuration files for the pmwiki container supporting bind mounting of the
  cookbook script's files at the directories `cookbook/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}/` and
  `pub/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}/`, and setting the `COOKBOOK` environment variable
  inside your container. This variable can then conveniently used by the
  `pmwiki_mirror_remote_site` script to determine the default cookbook in the
  container.
- `cookbook/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}/${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}.php`: a generated
  cookbook script supporting as starting point an `(:example:)` directive. This is
  the starting point for your own cookbook.
- `local/includecookbook.php` config script loaded by PmWiki, which loads the
  cookbook script.
- in the `wiki.d/` folder it creates the folowing wiki pages for documenting the
  cookbook in the wiki:
  - `Main.HomePage`: describes the cookbook, and immediately demonstrates an example
    of it
  - `Main.${CONFIG_COOKBOOK_NAME}`: in the official `PmWiki` site each cookbook is
    published with a so called recipe page. This page is such a recipe page already
    setup in its standard format and some values already filled in. The cookbook user
    only needs to add the description and details of the cookbook. The content of
    this page can then be used to publish the cookbook at the official PmWiki
    cookbook site.
  - `Main.SideBar`: sidebar menu linking above pages, and linking to pages
    interesting for a cookbook developer. The sidebar focus is on the cookbook and
    only links pages related to it.

## Revert setup to original git files

If you have changed files yourself or by running the `.devcontainer/setup` command or
by the `pmwiki_mirror_remote_site` command, and you want to revert to the original
git files you had after cloning, then you can do this by running the following
commands on the docker host. (not within the container)

1.  If the container is still running, first stop and remove it

         docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down

2.  To revert all files in working copy to their original version in git

         git checkout -- .

3.  Remove all files not tracked by git

         git clean -df

4.  Then you can start the container fresh again with either `docker compose` or
    `vscode`. Because you get a fresh container then all files in container will be
    from a fresh pmwiki install. Except for the files in the bind folders which
    persist on the host. For example the `local/config.php` file will be taken from
    the `./data/local` bind folder. Thus if you change the config it will persist
    after recreating the container fresh.

For convenience you can add the following alias to your `~/.bashrc`

    alias gitcleanrevert='git checkout -- .;git clean -df'

Instead of reverting and cleaning you could also just remove the folder and do a
fresh git clone.
